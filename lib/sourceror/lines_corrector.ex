  Corrects the line numbers of AST nodes such that they are correctly ordered.

  * If a node has no line number, it's assumed to be in the same line as the
    previous one.
  * If a node has a line number higher than the one before, it's kept as is.
  * If a node has a line number lower than the one before, its line number is
    recursively incremented by the line number difference, if it's not a
    pipeline operator.
  * If a node has leading comments, it's line number is incremented by the
    length of the comments list
  * If a node has trailing comments, it's end_of_expression and end line
    metadata are set to the line of their last child plus the trailing comments
